# Favored Techniques & Practices

## Functional Programming

Model your domain as data transformations

- Pure Functions
- Higher Order Functions
- First Class Functions
- Referential Transparency
- Avoid mutable state

## Object Oriented Programming

Organize your domain into units that encapsulate state and behavior

- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

## Test Driven Design 

For us, tests are not just about correctness, they apply pressure to the design. Constraining design decisions to those which are easy to test prevents our code from becoming difficult to maintain.

## Infrastructure as code 

- Wherever possible, infrastructure is disposable, immutable, reproducible and scripted.  
- Treat servers as commodities, not pets/job-security.
- Apply the principles of good code/design to architecture itself
