# Engineering at Arete

## What's it like to be an Arete Engineer?

### You're Serious about Code Quality

- Thrive in a culture that values and insists on clean code
- Say goodbye to documents; refactor your code until it speaks for itself
- Full TDD (red-­green-­refactor). Spend time coding rather than fixing bugs
- Become a full­-stack developer and work end­-to-­end to get the job done
- Say goodbye to turf wars -- all code is shared and nothing is off­-limits
- Don't get stuck in a box; pair­-program with experts from all over the stack

### You Are in Charge

- Shared architecture
- Small, agile team
- No QA teams
- Team­-driven, agile process

### You Make a Difference

- Help drive the creation of a new platform at the heart of the modern economy
- Blend your vision with ours to shape the product, outcomes & user experience
- You have something to say; everyone is a teacher ... everyone is a learner
- Continuous Delivery: one branch, multiple commits per day. All code is integrated, built, tested and deployed immediately
- Discover, work with, and develop cutting edge technology

## What are Arete engineers like?

- **CodeCraft**
  - Our engineers care a lot about code quality, make real decisions, and are respected for our ideas, not our tenure
- **Nice**
  - This is not an environment where everyone is off doing their own thing. We work together closely to solve problems, much of our code is done via pair programming, all of our code is reviewed.
- **Smart**
  - We work together to find the best solutions based on their merit after evaluating evidence and alternatives. This can involve debate as we puzzle through the solutions, and the final decision is based on facts, not feelings.
- **Curious**
  - We are not content the first time something happens to work, we figure out how and why it works, and look into alternatives.
- **Initiative**
  - If a technical issue annoys us, we don't complain about it (well, at least we don't JUST complain about it), we fix it.
- **Creative**
  - We don't like our work to be mundane. If something is tedious, we automate it.

## What is it like to work at Arete?

- Our continuous deployment is ... continous. This means that if you push code now, it will be live, in production, within minutes.  This is possible because we move fast, always commit to main, use feature toggles & code-branching to hide unfinished/unreleased work, and maintain an automated build+test+deployment pipeline triggered by every code push
- We do full lifecycle (full-stack) software development, so expect to be involved in every aspect of software engineering, from front end, to database, to requirements analysis, to helping choose which technology to use. This does not mean you have to be an expert in everything, most of us are only an expert in one, sometimes two areas. It does mean that you will be brought up to speed with a basic competence in all aspects of software engineering. You will always have help when dealing with areas you are less familiar with.
- We have an automated Quality Assurance department. Another way of saying this is that we don't have a QA department. Whenever you implement a feature, you are expected to write an automated test that reliably verifies that the feature has not become broken. This is not as hard as it may sound, and we have skilled people here that can show you how to write reliable tests efficiently. We also practice "Test Driven Design", wherein the primary function of tests is how they affect the design of the code, and verifying correctness is an important, but secondary concern.
- We are always improving our code, and even our oldest code benefits from constant review and refactoring.
- We practice agile software development. Check out the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) & [Software Craftsmanship Manifesto](https://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/). It is also worth looking into agile methodologies, such as Scrum, eXtreme Programming, and Kanban.
