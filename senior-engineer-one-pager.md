# Arete: Portfolio Management Platform

## https://aretealpha.com



## Are you serious about making an impact? 

We're the engineering team building [Arete](https://aretealpha.com/), the portfolio management software that's revolutionizing the way PE/VC firms and their portfolio companies interact.  We're hiring a full-stack, **Senior Engineer** to join our **founding team**.  This is a unique opportunity to impact a green-field platform, use a cutting-edge tech stack, and make an impact in a highly important industry.



## What's it like to be an Arete Engineer?

### You Make a Difference

- Help drive the creation of a new platform at the heart of the modern economy
- Blend your vision with ours to shape the product, outcomes & user experience
- You have something to say; everyone is a teacher ... everyone is a learner
- Continuous Delivery: one branch, multiple commits per day. All code is integrated, built, tested and deployed immediately
- Discover, work with, and develop cutting edge technology

### You Are in Charge

- Shared architecture
- Small, agile team
- No QA teams
- Team­-driven, agile process

### You're Serious about Code Quality

- Thrive in a culture that values and insists on clean code
- Say goodbye to documents; refactor your code until it speaks for itself
- Full TDD (red-­green-­refactor). Spend time coding rather than fixing bugs
- Become a full­-stack developer and work end­-to-­end to get the job done
- Say goodbye to turf wars -- all code is shared and nothing is off­-limits
- Don't get stuck in a box; pair­-program with experts from all over the stack



## You: The Founding Senior Engineer

#### Your Experience and Wisdom is What Makes You A Senior Engineer

An Arete Senior Engineer is someone who has been "around the block" a few times, and has the scars & wisdom to prove it.

- Has worked on multiple full-stack projects
- Has experience in the full lifecycle of software development
- Has developed opinions on libraries, languages, tools & practices, and can articulate the reasons behind them
- Can mentor junior engineers
- Contributes to architecture & design at a senior level
- Can stand-in for the team-lead when needed
- Typically has at least 4-5 years of experience

Ideally: they have experience with many of the technologies in our [tech-stack](https://github.com/aretealpha/engineering/blob/main/tech-stack.md), especially React, Kotlin/JVM and AWS



#### Your Intelligence, Curiosity & Initiative is What Makes You Arete

Arete Engineers are aligned with [our way of working](https://github.com/aretealpha/engineering/blob/main/engineering-at-arete.md). This means they're nice, smart, curious, creative, and show initiative.

Technically, they are (or aspire to be) full-stack. This means they are willing to be involved in every aspect of software engineering, from front end, to database, to requirements analysis, to helping choose which technology to use. This does not mean they have to be an expert in everything, most of us are only an expert in one, sometimes two areas. It does mean that they will be brought up to speed with a basic competence in all aspects of software engineering.

Ideally, they are enthusiastic about our [tech-stack](https://github.com/aretealpha/engineering/blob/main/tech-stack.md) and [techniques-and-practices](https://github.com/aretealpha/engineering/blob/main/techniques-and-practices.md)
